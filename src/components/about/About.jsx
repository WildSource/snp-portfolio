      <h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
      <p>
        Hi, my name is Samuel Nguyen-Phok, and I’m a web developer based in Quebec, Canada. <br></br>
        While I’m skilled in both frontend and backend development, my passion lies in backend work, where I can focus on building robust, 
        scalable systems. <br></br>
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond web development, I have a deep interest in programming languages—particularly their paradigms, 
        such as functional programming—and enjoy exploring topics like compilers, interpreters, and even quirky esoteric languages. <br></br>
      </p>

      <hr className='abouthr'></hr>

      <p>
        In my free time, I create illustrations and comics, often for mature audiences. 
        One of my proudest accomplishments is developing a personal comic publishing website, 
        where I combined my technical skills with my creative passion.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        I’m always excited to take on new challenges, whether it’s solving complex backend problems or diving into creative projects. 
      </p>
